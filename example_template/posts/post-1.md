# Welcome to an example post!

The piece of text at the top of this file is called the "front matter". It's used to set the title, date, and categories of the post. The categories are used to generate the "Categories" page.

The rest of this file is written in Markdown. It's a simple markup language that's easy to learn. You can find a guide [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

If you want to add images to your post, you can put them in the `images` folder and reference them like this:
![An Image](./images/blog.jpg)
