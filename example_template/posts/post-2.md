The `posts` folder is where you'll put all of your blog posts. Each post is a Markdown file with a `.md` extension. The name of the file will be used as the URL of the post.

The intention is that you put all posts in that folder without any further subfolders. This makes it easy to generate the "All Posts" page.

You can group posts together using categories like the ones that have been added to this post. You can add as many categories as you like to each post. The categories are used to generate the "Categories" page.
